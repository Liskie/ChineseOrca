      <trnslt>Write an article based on this summary:\nAfter a thief walked out of a New York gallery with a Salvador Dali drawing only to later return it by mail, observers were scratching their heads—but now they have an explanation, via prosecutors. Authorities arrested Greek fashion publicist Phivos Lampros Istavrioglou, 29, in the case; he has pleaded not guilty, the Wall Street Journal reports. The back story: At the gallery, Istavrioglou realized the $150,000 drawing was unprotected and removed it, taking it with him back to Athens, prosecutors say. Once he arrived, prosecutors say he had second thoughts. \"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked\" and sent it back, rolling it up \"in a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster.\" Among the evidence detectives are said to have uncovered in the case: Istavriglou's fingerprint on the mailing tube, relevant Web searches made from his Google account before the story broke, and a photo of the drawing in the gallery that he posted to his Facebook page. Istavrioglou was caught after an undercover cop posed as a New York art gallery manager and offered him a job, returning him to the Big Apple. He's due back in court today, the New York Times notes.</trnslt>\n\n

      <trnslt>根据以下摘要撰写一篇文章：\n一名窃贼从纽约的一家画廊拿走一幅萨尔瓦多·达利的画作后，随后又通过邮件将其归还，令人感到困惑，但现在检察官们提供了一个解释。警方逮捕了29岁的希腊时尚公关费沃斯·兰普洛斯·伊斯塔夫里奥格鲁，并指控他参与了这起案件。据《华尔街日报》报道，兰普洛斯已否认有罪。事情的起因是，在画廊里，伊斯塔夫里奥格鲁发现了这幅价值150,000美元的作品并且没有受到保护，于是将其取走，带回了雅典。检察官表示，当他到达雅典后，他开始反悔。\"当他意识到追捕行动已经开始，被告便退缩了\"，并将画卷寄回，卷起画作的方式\"就像大学宿舍里的海报一样\"。据说侦探在此案中发现的证据包括：Istavriglou 的指纹留在邮寄用管上，他在案发前用谷歌账号进行的相关搜索，以及他将画廊中的画作照片发布到自己脸书页面。在一名卧底警察伪装成纽约美术馆经理并为他提供工作的帮助下，伊斯塔夫里奥格鲁被捕并被带回纽约。据《纽约时报》报道，他今天将再次出庭。 </trnslt>\n\n
